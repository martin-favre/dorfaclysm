☐ Make mined rocks drop items
    Items in world are contained in an itemcontainer
    Itemcontainers contains items.
    There can only be one itemcontainer per block
    When a block is removed spawns a blockitem
    A blockitem is a sort of item (have to change name of worlditem)
    A blockitem contains an enum of which block it represents
    When used on a block is spawns the block is represents.
    What is an item?
        A name
        A value
        A description
        A sprite
        Item can be equippable, where is then can affect stats
        Item can be placeable, where it contains blockinfo 

Bug: Should only be able to see GameObjects on the current level

☐ Re-build a rock with a dropped rock item
    When 

☐ Make block last more than one hit


☐ Be able to zoom in/out of the map
    Quite messy
    If I move this to 3D I'll get this for free

☐ Idea: Use Streaming texture for the GridMapRenderer
